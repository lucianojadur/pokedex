A naive implementation of a basic interactive-pokedex - the main Pokemon database- for run on Console. Written in ***Java*** for Unix-based OSs.

# EXECUTION
	
	$ ./main [username.csv]
	
	[username.csv] is an optional argument in case of the user has previously initialized the application with that <username> id.


If not existing [username.csv] file, it'll ask the user for its username and create a new file with that username from a default database file included in the repo once modified that initial database or after quiting the program.
